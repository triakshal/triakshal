The SI units for charge Q is the Coulomb.
Charge is quantised, meaning the charge of anything is an integer multiple of $e/3$. 
The charges of the proton and electron are exactly opposite: $$\pm 1.602*10^{19} C$$
Charge is conserved, meaning that new charge can't be created. Like charges repel, while opposite charges attract. 

The Coulomb force of one object on another is defined  by the following: 
$$\vec{F}_{1,2} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{r}_{1,2}$$
Where $q$ is the charge of each object, $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing in the direction of object 1 to object 2 , and $r$ being the distance between. $k$ is Coulomb's constant: 
$$k \approx 9 \times 10^9 \frac{N \cdot m^2}{C^2}$$
This is known as *Coulomb's Law.*
In terms of the speed of light, $$k = c^2 \times 10^{-7} \frac{N \cdot s^2}{C^2}$$


Reiterating in detail, the general form of Coulomb's Law in terms of vacuum permittivity:
$$ \vec{F_e} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{r} $$
Where:

- $\vec{F_e}$ is the vector representing the Coulomb force.
- $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity with a value of $8.854 \times 10^{-12} , \text{F} \cdot \text{m}^{-1}$.
- $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the signed magnitudes of the charges.
- $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing from $q_1$ to $q_2$.
- $r$ is the distance between the charges.
