Just as mirrors can form an image, lenses form images. 
Similar to mirrors, tracing rays works well to find image locations, but with slightly modified rules. 

For converging lenses:

- Rays parallel to the optical axis will pass through the focal point on the opposite side of the lens
- Rays passing through the optical axis will pass through undeflected
- Rays passing through the focal point, or coming on a line coming through the focal point, on the same side as the object will emerge parallel to the optical axis
- If the object is farther than the focal point, the image is real and inverted
- If the object is nearer than the focal point, the image is virtual and upright
- Acts like a concave mirror

For diverging lenses: 

- Rays parallel to the optical axis will appear to come from the focal point on the same side as the object
- Rays passing through the optical axis will pass through undeflected
- Rays directed at the focal point on the opposite side of the object will emerge parallel to the optical axis
- The image is always virtual and upright
- Acts like convex mirror

### Equations

$$
\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f},
\ 
 \  
m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}
$$

- $f$ is positive for a converging lens: $f > 0$.
- $f$ is negative for a diverging lens: $f < 0$.
- $d_o$ is the distance to the object and is positive for a real object: $d_o > 0$.
- $d_i$ is the distance to the image and is:
  - positive for a real image ($d_i > 0$, opposite side of the lens from the object),
  - negative for a virtual image ($d_i < 0$, same side of the lens as the object).
