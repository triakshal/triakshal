The fact that light refracts can be used to create a lens. Glass can be used to make images which can be magnified- either smaller or larger depending on the use case. 

The two classic lens types are converging and diverging lenses. 

| Converging                         | Diverging                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Light bends towards axis           | Light bends away from Axis   |
| Can produce real or virtual images | Produces only virtual images |

The surface shape of most lenses resembles a section of a sphere.
A thin lens has two main characteristics: 

- its thickness is negligible compared to its radius of curvature
- its overall size is negligible compared to its radius of curvature

These properties are conducive to a sharp image, since the rays converge better. The shape is also easier to geometrically analyse. 

You can easily show that if the second side is curved, the relationship becomes:

$$\left( \frac{n_2}{n_1} - 1 \right) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right) = \frac{1}{f} $$

Where ( R_1 ) is for the surface toward the object, and ( R_2 ) the opposite side.

We define ( R ) to be positive if it is convex toward the object, and negative if it is concave toward the object. For a converging lens, ( f ) is positive, and for a diverging lens, ( f ) is negative.
