Light is a wave made up of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. Unlike mechanical waves, it doesn't need a medium to travel through. Light carries both momentum and energy, and the energy is quantised; it depends on the wavelength of the light. Light experiences the doppler shift and interference. 

	However, interference is only evident when light interacts with objects of comparable size to light's wavelength, and Doppler shift is evident only when speeds are comparable to the speed of light. 

Visible light differs from other electromagnetic waves on the EM spectrum only by wavelength; it's simply just the part of the spectrum which can be visibly observed. 

Generally, the wave properties of light are not evident since the wavelength is far too small, and light instead appears to act as if it were composed of particles moving in a straight line: hence, 'rays'. The study of behaviour of light rays when interacting with lenses and mirrors is called *geometric optics.* 

## Reflection

In the case of a perfectly flat surface which reflects 100% of light, the angle of incidence of light $\theta_{i}$ is equal to the angle of reflection $\theta_{r}$ , where both angles are measured relative to the normal of the surface.
