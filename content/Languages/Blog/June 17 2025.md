I'd like to document my language learning process here, including but not limited to my input resources, practise methods, and some practise output. I'll try to share progress once in a while with random updates. Using the internet is an ever-growing part of the daily human schedule, and the ability to digitally read and write is a unique aspect of language-learning that focuses on less-utilised aspects of (foreign) language learning- it can be seen from an English perspective: we speak much differently than we communicate digitally, both formally and informally, and what better way to work on this digital aspect than to engage in it directly?

Of course, conventional language-learning focus remains more important and fulfilling overall, as it engages with social dynamics, comprehension, and much more- but it's difficult to showcase or practise that in a website format like this; it's best done by going out and talking, listening. I'll document whatever I can here for the various languages I dabble in and pick up on.
