## About Me
Hello! My name is Triaksha. 

I'm currently studying for an electrical engineering degree, and I'm also taking advanced math courses to supplement my degree. Outside of academics, I read about history and (try to) learn different languages. I'm planning to incorporate some personal projects into my breaks between university semesters, and I hope to showcase some of my learning process for me to reflect on in the future.   

I also enjoy casually taking photos on my phone, and I have a collection of scenery photos uploaded on an older site. I'll see if I can include them on this one to consolidate everything.

The primary tags for this site are tagged here to simplify navigation, and I'll update them as I add more.
