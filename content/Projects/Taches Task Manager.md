I've started to learn Python (and coding in general) after a long break, and I'm starting from near the point of a beginner. I plan to keep up a few projects here and there to ensure I'm well-versed in syntax and that I build a deeper understanding of logic.   

This first project is from roadmap.sh, and is a simple CLI task manager with a few basic functions including adding, removing, and modifying tasks. There are options to change their completion status, and there is of course a list view to see which tasks are left and which are complete.   

Maybe I'll revisit after learning a while more; adding more functionality and a neat GUI to wrap it sounds interesting and fun to explore.
